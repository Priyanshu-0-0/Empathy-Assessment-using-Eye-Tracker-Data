The Jupyter Notebook  has 4 parts<br>
Part 1 - Loading and combing the datasets<br>
Part 2 - Analyising the data <br>
Part 3 - Pre-Processing the data
Part 4 - All the Models and there results<br>
In oder to run the file follow the following Steps<br><br><br>

Step 1<br>
Install all the Libaries/Pacages Required for the Code<br>
For refernce  - https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/<br><br><br>

Step 2<br>
Download the data set from the link <br>
Link of the data set- https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Eye_Tracker_Data/19729636/2<br>
Feature Description pdf - https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Questionnaires/19657323/2<br>
Feature Description pdf contains the Explanation for the Features in the datasets and there format<br><br><br>

Step 3<br>
Unzip the data in our pc <br><br><br>

Step 4 <br>
In part 1 of the code change the path of the file<br>
for eg <br>
My Path is  = "Data/EyeT/gayze_test_letter_card_participant"<br>
Your Path should be  = "add your path /gayze_test_letter_card_participant" <br>
Do this for all 3 paths in part 1<br><br><br><br>

Step 5<br>
After all the above steps the code should work fine but Pandas Profiling can take some time so its commented and the report is not saved in the Jupyter Notebook but  the data_report.html provided in the Repository
